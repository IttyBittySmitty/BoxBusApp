# Capstone Project Proposal: BoxBus Delivery Application

## Project Overview

**Application Name:** BoxBus  
**Project Type:** Full-Stack Mobile and Web Delivery Application  
**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Target Platform:** Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web)

## Problem Statement

The modern delivery landscape lacks a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that serves both individual customers and businesses with flexible delivery options. Current solutions often have rigid pricing structures, limited delivery windows, and poor driver-customer communication. BoxBus addresses these pain points by providing:

- **Transparent, dynamic pricing** based on weight, distance, and delivery urgency
- **Flexible delivery windows** from next-day to 2-hour rush delivery
- **Multi-user ecosystem** supporting customers, drivers, and administrators

   - Secure JWT-based authentication
   - User profile management with contact information

2. **Order Management System**
   - Package specification (weight, dimensions, fragility)
   - Pickup and delivery address management
   - Real-time delivery quote calculation
   - Order status tracking (Pending → Confirmed → Assigned → Picked Up → In Transit → Delivered)

3. **Dynamic Pricing Engine**
   - Base delivery fee: $15.00
   - Distance-based pricing ($0.75/km over 15km)
   - Weight-based pricing with scaling reductions for heavy packages
   - Delivery window multipliers (Next-day: 1.0x, Same-day: 1.25x, Rush: 1.75x)
   - Automatic GST calculation (5%)

4. **Delivery Window Options**
   - **Next Day:** Standard delivery within 48 hours
   - **Same Day:** Delivery by 9:00 PM (25% premium, cutoff 9:00 AM)
   - **Rush:** 2-hour delivery window (75% premium, cutoff 7:00 PM)

5. **Driver Portal**
   - Available order browsing and acceptance
   - Real-time order status updates
   - Earnings tracking and commission management
   - Performance analytics

6. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Order oversight and management
   - Driver performance monitoring
   - Business analytics and reporting
   - User management capabilities

### Advanced Features
- **Package Insurance:** Built-in $1,000 coverage for all deliveries
- **Photo Documentation:** Package photo capture for verification
